## Overview ℹ️
This project is my last task as an AI intern at the virtual internship from [TEKNOSOFT](https://www.linkedin.com/company/teknosoft). It aims to recognize credit cards and their components in images and videos using the YOLOv9 object detection model.

## Key Features 📊
- Data Acquisition: Obtained credit card images from [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/search?q=visa%20card%20recognition).
- Model Training: Trained YOLOv9 on the custom dataset with specified hyperparameters.
- Inference: Performed inference on test data to evaluate model performance.
- Results: Achieved high precision and recall, with visualizations of model predictions.
  
## Acknowledgments 🙏
Roboflow Universe: Provided credit card dataset.
YOLOv9: Object detection model used in the project.
