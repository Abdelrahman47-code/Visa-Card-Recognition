Overview ℹ️
This project aims to detect credit cards in images and videos using the YOLOv9 object detection model. By training the model on a custom dataset, we can accurately locate credit cards with bounding boxes.

Key Features 📊
Data Acquisition: Obtained credit card images from Roboflow Universe.
Model Training: Trained YOLOv9 on the custom dataset with specified hyperparameters.
Inference: Performed inference on test data to evaluate model performance.
Results: Achieved high precision and recall, with visualizations of model predictions.
How to Use 🛠️
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-cards-recognition.git
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the model: python train.py
Perform inference: python detect.py
